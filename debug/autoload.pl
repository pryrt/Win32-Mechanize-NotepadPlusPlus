Since that works, my idea for Editor.pm (or a big portion):

Map the PythonScript-based method name to the https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html nomenclature
    For example,
        %ok = (
            getText => "SCI_GETTEXT(position length, char *text) â†’ position"
        );

In autoload,
    1. check if the key exists
    2. if it does, parse the value $ok{$cmd} to create a wrapper sub
        1. make sure that $message exists in %scimsg
        2. write the wrapper and define `*$cmd = sub ...`
        3. `goto &$cmd`
        4. since we defined that sub, in future calls, it will just call that sub
    3. else die with the undefined-subroutine error
