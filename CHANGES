Revision history for Perl distribution Win32-Mechanize-NotepadPlusPlus

v0.xxx
    - test suite bug: with v7.9.1 and newer, replaceTargetText() changes
      the selection/getTargetText() value, so update the readback
      to be version agnostic (#57)
    - documentation error: fox %NPPIDM description in Notepad.pm (#53)

v0.005 2020-Oct-16
    - replace %ENCODINGKEY with %BUFFERENCODING, because the old hash
      had wrong values that didn't match getEncoding's return values
      (#50)
    - add setEncoding command to call NPPM_SETBUFFERENCODING
      as the logical pair to getEncoding (#51)

v0.004001 2020-Jun-20
    - fix bug in notepad->prompt(), which only used two of the three
      arguments, in wrong order (#47); test suite verifies default
      values for title and default when they aren't used
    - added new examples/pasteSpecial.pl to show how to paste a
      clipboard entry other than CF_TEXT into Notepad++

v0.004 2020-Jun-04
    - fix bug in propertyNames() which deleted final char (#45)
    - implemented helper methods: forEachLine, deleteLine, replaceWholeLine,
        replaceLine, flash, getWord, getCurrentWord, getUserLineSelection,
        getUserCharSelection (#15)
    - make setTarget an alias of setTargetRange, and write an alias of
        addText, for PythonScript compatibility (#15)
    - implemented new auto-wrapper to get searchInTarget and similar calls
        to work right (#42)
    - fixed replaceTarget() and replaceTargetRE() replacing target with the
        empty string (#41)
    - fixed length bug in getTargetText() (#40)
    - fixed bug in editor->setText('') which had empty strings
        cause crash (#39)

v0.003 2020-Apr-06
    - fix mistakes and missing information in the POD (#35)
    - add author tests for checking for autogen entries not in the
        message list, and also note scintilla messages missing
        from autogen that aren't manually implemented or deprecated
        (#34)
    - some NPP v7.8 messages were missing, so add them (#29)
        and add a make target to make that easier to do in the future
    - added version notes, to say which messages and enums require
        NPP v7.8 (because these are the SCI v4.2.0 updates)
    - runPluginsCommand() = fixed command cache feature and improved
        test (#30)
    - test suite: add delay in myTestHelpers to make sure there's
        enough time after Notepad++ started before trying to save the
        session (to avoid race condition with no files loaded yet)

v0.002 2020-Mar-21
    - Reorganize the hash variables for easier and clearer use going
        forward (#13)
    - editor->getLine() on an empty line will now correctly return an empty
        string, not "\0" (fixed #14)

        FULL_CURRENT_PATH and CURRENT_WORD (#19)
    - improve documentation internal links (#20)
    - make the editor->hwnd() a public method (instead of using
        editor()->{_hwnd})
    - make the notepad->hwnd() a public method (instead of using
        notepad()->{_hwnd})
    - add helper editor->getEOLString(): convert EOL Mode integer to a string
    - editor->getFileEndPosition(): gives the end position of the
        whole document
    - improve test coverage: add encoding names and getLanguageName coverage
        to npp-buffer.t
    - examples/ folder: adding more example usages
    - improve Editor documentation on ->findText and some other methods, and
        clean up set/get pairs, so they share the same information

        source file
