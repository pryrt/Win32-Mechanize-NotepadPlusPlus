TODO
    - per-version debug:
        * DONE: v5.20
            * DONE: fixed dependency list
            * DONE: didn't have installdeps bug <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pryrt/win32-mechanize-notepadplusplus/builds/30695247/job/o9ynw0grayq8io82>
        - v5.14: `cpan --installdeps .`: it's not trying to install anything,
            even though dependencies are not met.
            * DONE: workaround: cpanm --force Win32::GUI Win32::GuiTest Path::Tiny
            - need to locally investigate cpanm versions, and see whether it can be
              _fixed_ by in-place upgrade of cpanm
        - v5.12:
            * DONE: doesn't have the `cpan --installdeps .` bug, because I had to manually install
                App::cpanminus via cpan.bat, so it gets newest
            - Win32::API v0.84 doesn't install due to errors; need to investigate locally
                - RESULTS: not installing all the dependencies for Win32::API before Win32::API.
                - TRY: for $] < 5.014, add (for appveyor)
                        Config::Perl::V 0
                        Encode::compat 0
                        Math::Int64 0

        - v5.10:
            - only comes in 32bit, so need 32bit development environment
            - requires 32bit chocolately installs for appveyor; see below
            - probably will have the intalldeps and/or Win32::API problems as well
            - definitely will trigger the `cpan -i App::cpanminus` condition
    - verify locally 32bit/32bit
    - prune out more of the printing in the non-verbose test suite
    - fix arrows in docs

NOTES: 32bit appveyor:
    + chocolatey option "--forcex86" will grab the 32-bit instead of the 64bit
    + verified that both strawberry and notepad++ come with files or urls for both 32-bit and 64-bit
    + might be able to `set use64vs32 = --forcex86` for my 32-bit test, or empty
    + set blah= & rem "space ampersand rem = value is a literal space"
        => so could use that when setting the use64vs32 for 64bit
        => or just do
            IF DEFINED ForceX86 (cinst %ForceX86 ...) ELSE (cinst ...)
