TODO
    - per-version debug:
        - v5.10:
            - only comes in 32bit, so need 32bit development environment
            - can't get even dependencies working on AppVeyor
            - need to debug/test locally-only
            - procedure: 
                - clone portable
                - cpan -i App::cpanminus
                - cpanm Config::Perl::V
                - cpanm Encode::compat
                - cpanm Math::Int64
                - cpanm Win32::API      # >= 0.71 for WINAPI calling convention
                - PATH c:\usr\local\apps\npp-other\npp.7.8.4.bin.x32\;%PATH%    # put npp 32bit at start of path
                - cpanm --installdeps .
    - verify locally 32bit/32bit
    - prune out more of the printing in the non-verbose test suite
    - fix arrows in docs

AppVeyor Noter:
    - cannot get appveyor to install v5.10 dependencies, even though
        they work on my local v5.10; so, for AppVeyor, only go down to v5.12,
        and rely on
    - 32bit appveyor ideas:
        + use "modern" perl version, but with 32bit
        + chocolatey option "--forcex86" will grab the 32-bit instead of the 64bit
        + verified that both strawberry and notepad++ come with files or urls for both 32-bit and 64-bit
        + might be able to `set use64vs32 = --forcex86` for my 32-bit test, or empty
        + set blah= & rem "space ampersand rem = value is a literal space"
            => so could use that when setting the use64vs32 for 64bit
            => or just do
                IF DEFINED ForceX86 (cinst %ForceX86 ...) ELSE (cinst ...)
