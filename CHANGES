    - update for Notepad++ v8.4 - v8.53 (#88)
      - Editor: getText() and similar need retval+1 to allocate

        (#87, #88)
      - Editor: a plethora of new messages and enumerations (hashes)
        (too many to list)

    - fix to work with versions after v8.2.1 (the Scintilla
      range structure changed from 32bit to 64bit) (#84)
    - delayed adding new v8.1.5 message, because new messages
      are not critical to functionality (#85 left open)

v0.008 2021-Sep-11
    - add notepad->showDocList, notepad->isDocListShown,
      and notepad->docListDisableColumn for working with the

v0.006001 2021-Mar-07

      because it was causing fails

v0.006 2021-Mar-06
    - add getSettingsOnCloudPath() with test (#54)
    - add getLineNumberWidthMode(), setLineNumberWidthMode(), and
      the %LINENUMWIDTH enumeration with test (#54 addendeum)
    - test suite bug: with v7.9.1 and newer, replaceTargetText() changes
      the selection/getTargetText() value, so update the readback
      to be version agnostic (#57)
    - documentation error: fox %NPPIDM description in Notepad.pm (#53)
    - meta fix: make test suite pass on cpantesters smoke testers,

      an old, incompatible version (#56)

v0.005 2020-Oct-16
    - replace %ENCODINGKEY with %BUFFERENCODING, because the old hash

      as the logical pair to getEncoding (#51)

v0.004001 2020-Jun-20

        replaceLine, flash, getWord, getCurrentWord, getUserLineSelection,
        getUserCharSelection (#15)
    - make setTarget an alias of setTargetRange, and write an alias of
        addText, for PythonScript compatibility (#15)

        to work right (#42)

        empty string (#41)

    - fix mistakes and missing information in the POD (#35)
    - add author tests for checking for autogen entries not in the
        message list, and also note scintilla messages missing
        from autogen that aren't manually implemented or deprecated
        (#34)
    - some NPP v7.8 messages were missing, so add them (#29)
        and add a make target to make that easier to do in the future
    - added version notes, to say which messages and enums require
        NPP v7.8 (because these are the SCI v4.2.0 updates)
    - runPluginsCommand() = fixed command cache feature and improved
        test (#30)
    - test suite: add delay in myTestHelpers to make sure there's
        enough time after Notepad++ started before trying to save the
        session (to avoid race condition with no files loaded yet)

v0.002 2020-Mar-21
    - Reorganize the hash variables for easier and clearer use going
        forward (#13)

        FULL_CURRENT_PATH and CURRENT_WORD (#19)

        editor()->{_hwnd})
    - make the notepad->hwnd() a public method (instead of using
        notepad()->{_hwnd})
    - add helper editor->getEOLString(): convert EOL Mode integer to a string
    - editor->getFileEndPosition(): gives the end position of the
        whole document
    - improve test coverage: add encoding names and getLanguageName coverage
        to npp-buffer.t
    - examples/ folder: adding more example usages
    - improve Editor documentation on ->findText and some other methods, and
        clean up set/get pairs, so they share the same information

        source file
