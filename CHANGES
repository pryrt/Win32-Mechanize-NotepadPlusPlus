Revision history for Perl distribution Win32-Mechanize-NotepadPlusPlus

TODO
    - fix arrows in docs
    - need to get a successful 32-bit environment, with _recent_ 32bit perl and 32bit Notepad++
        and see how to replicate that in Appveyor as well (forcing cinst to grab 32b versions)
        - after that, I can go back and look into getting older 32bit versions to work
    - Appveyor perl v5.10 is failing on Win32::GUI and Win32::GuiTest installations; need to debug
        - Two problems:
            - strawberry v5.10 is 32bit-only
            - Doesn't seem to be able to install full dependency chain, with a recent enough Win32::API
              to work with this module.
