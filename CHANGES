TODO
    - per-version debug:
        - v5.10:
            - only comes in 32bit, so need 32bit development environment
            - requires 32bit chocolately installs for appveyor; see below
            - probably will have the intalldeps and/or Win32::API problems as well
            - definitely will trigger the `cpan -i App::cpanminus` condition
    - verify locally 32bit/32bit
    - prune out more of the printing in the non-verbose test suite
    - fix arrows in docs

NOTES: 32bit appveyor:
    + chocolatey option "--forcex86" will grab the 32-bit instead of the 64bit
    + verified that both strawberry and notepad++ come with files or urls for both 32-bit and 64-bit
    + might be able to `set use64vs32 = --forcex86` for my 32-bit test, or empty
    + set blah= & rem "space ampersand rem = value is a literal space"
        => so could use that when setting the use64vs32 for 64bit
        => or just do
            IF DEFINED ForceX86 (cinst %ForceX86 ...) ELSE (cinst ...)
